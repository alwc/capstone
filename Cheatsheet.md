# Capstone cheatsheet

## Ink

* **Ink** - Tap the pink "Ink" button to enter ink mode. Draw with the stylus anywhere. Tap again to deactivate.
* **Erase** - Tap the pink "Erase" button to enter erase mode. Draw with the stylus to erase ink. Tap again to deactivate.

## Boards

* **Create board** - Drag stylus from the left or right edge of the screen to create a new board.
* **Enter board** - Pinch in or double-tap a board to zoom into it.
* **Exit board** - Pinch out to zoom out from a board.

## Cards

* **Move card** - Use the stylus to drag boards, images, text, or web clippings.
* **Resize card** - Touch the stylus in the bottom-right corner of the card and drag to resize.
* **Mirror card** - Put your finger on the card and then use the stylus to drag off a mirror of the card. It's a reference, so any changes to the either card will be reflected in both.
* **Delete card** - Drag the card to the edge of the screen to delete it ("throw it off the edge of the world").
* **Enter card** - Pinch into or out of a card to view it fullscreen.

## Shelf

* **Summon, dismiss, or resize shelf** - Drag up with finger from the bottom of the screen to pull out the shelf (a scratchpad area for cards). Shelf can be resized. Note: Don't drag from all the way at the bottom, otherwise you'll pull up the Chrome OS taskbar.
* **Add things to and remove things from shelf** - Drag cards with the stylus to bring them off of a board and onto your shelf and vice-versa. The card is on the shelf only when it is entirely below the shelf top edge.

## Clip

Install Clipper extension on your Pixelbook. Then from the Chrome web browser:

* **Clip image** - Right-click or two-finger tap an image on the web and select "Send to Capstone".
* **Clip text** - Select text, tap "...", and select "Send to Capstone".
* **Clip website** - Press the "C" button in the Chrome address bar to clip an entire website.
* **Paste text or images** - Select the Capstone app on your desktop and you can paste text or images into it.

In all cases, the clipped content will land on your shelf. If your shelf isn't visible, pull up from the button of the screen with a finger to reveal. Then drag the card onto a board and manipulate as normal.
