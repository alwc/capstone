# Capstone cheatsheet

## Ink

* **Ink** - Tap the pink "Ink" button to enter ink mode. Draw with the stylus anywhere. Tap again to deactivate.
* **Erase** - Tap the pink "Erase" button to enter erase mode. Draw with the stylus to erase ink. Tap again to deactivate.

## Boards

* **Create board** - Drag stylus from the left or right edge of the screen to create a new board.
* **Enter board** - Pinch in or double-tap a board to zoom into it.
* **Exit board** - Pinch out to zoom out from a board.

## Cards

* **Move card** - Use the stylus to drag boards, images, text, or web clippings.
* **Resize card** - Touch the stylus in the bottom-right corner of the card and drag to resize.
* **Mirror card** - Put your finger on the card and then use the stylus to drag off a mirror of the card. It's a reference, so any changes to the either card will be reflected in both.
* **Delete card** - Drag the card to the edge of the screen to delete it ("throw it off the edge of the world").

## Shelf

* **Summon, dismiss, or resize shelf** - Drag up with finger from the bottom of the screen to pull out the shelf (a scratchpad area for cards). Shelf can be resized. Note: Don't drag from all the way at the bottom, otherwise you'll pull up the Chrome OS taskbar.
* **Add things to and remove things from shelf** - Drag cards with the stylus to bring them off of a board and onto your shelf and vice-versa. The card is on the shelf only when it is entirely below the shelf top edge.
