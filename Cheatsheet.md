# Capstone cheatsheet

## Navigation

* **Enter item** - Two-finger pinch in or double-tap an item to zoom in to it
  (a board, web clip, image, etc.)
* **Exit item** - Two-finger pinch out to zoom back out.
* **Create board** - Drag stylus from the left or right edge of the screen to
  create a new board within the current one.

## Ink

* **Ink** - While on a board, tap the circle in the lower-left corner to enter
  ink mode. Draw with the stylus. Tap again to deactivate.
* **Erase** - While on a board, tap the square in the lower-left corner to
  enter erase mode. Draw with the stylus to erase ink. Tap again to deactivate.

## Cards

* **Move card** - Use the stylus to drag boards, images, text, or web
  clippings.
* **Resize card** - Touch the stylus in the bottom-right corner of the card and
  drag to resize.
* **Mirror card** - Put your finger on the card and then use the stylus to drag
  off a mirror of the card. It's a reference, so any changes to the either card
  will be reflected in both.
* **Delete card** - Drag the card to the edge of the screen to delete it ("throw
  it off the edge of the world").

## Shelf

* **Summon, dismiss, or resize shelf** - Drag up with finger from the bottom of
  the screen to pull out the shelf (a scratchpad area for cards). Shelf can be
  resized. Note: Don't drag from all the way at the bottom, otherwise you'll
  pull up the Chrome OS taskbar.
* **Add things to and remove things from shelf** - Drag cards with the stylus to
  bring them off of a board and onto your shelf and vice-versa. The card is on
  the shelf only when it is entirely below the shelf top edge.

## Chrome extension

* **Clip image** - Right-click or two-finger tap an image on the web and select
  "Send to Capstone".
* **Clip text** - Select text, tap "...", and select "Send to Capstone".
* **Clip website** - Press the "C" button in the Chrome address bar to clip an
  entire website.

## Desktop app

* **Paste text or images** - Select the Capstone app on your desktop and you can
  paste text or images into it.
* **Drag & drop files from your computer** - Drag images or text files into
  Capstone to import them on your desktop.

For both the Chrome extension and desktop app, the clipped content will land on
your shelf. If your shelf isn't visible, pull up from the button of the screen
with a finger to reveal. Then drag the card onto a board and manipulate as normal.
