* **Enter board** - Pinch in or double-tap a board to zoom into it.
* **Exit board** - Pinch out to zoom out from a board.
* **Drag card** - Use the stylus to move boards, images, text, or web clippings.
* **Delete card** - Drag the card to the edge of the screen to delete it ("throw it off the edge of the world").

## Shelf

* **Summon, dismiss, or resize shelf** - Drag up with finger from the bottom of the screen to pull out the shelf (a scratchpad area for cards). Shelf can be resized. Note: Don't drag from all the way at the bottom, otherwise you'll pull up the Chrome OS taskbar.
